K-means is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that solve the well known clustering problem. 

The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify a given data set through a certain number of clusters 

K-means algorithm consists of following steps:
1) Place K points into the space represented by the objects that are being clustered. These points represent initial group centroids.

2) Assign each object to the group that has the closest centroid.

3) When all objects have been assigned, recalculate the positions of the K centroids.

4) Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until the centroids no longer move. This produces a separation of the objects into groups from which the metric to be minimized can be calculated.
